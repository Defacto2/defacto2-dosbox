A self-contained emulation package that we use to capture screenshots and troubleshoot [MS-DOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MS-DOS) software and programs offered for [download on the website](https://defacto2.net/file/list?output=card&platform=dos&section=-&sort=posted_desc&perpage=100).

The package comprises of [D-Fend](http://dfendreloaded.sourceforge.net/), [DOSBox SVN-lfn](https://www.dosbox.com/wiki/SVN_Builds), custom D-Fend `Confs` and a selection of DOS tools and utilities.

#### Install

Unfortunately only for Windows.

Option 1 - Zip download

1. Select **Download ZIP** from the green **Clone or download** button on the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Defacto2/defacto2-dosbox).
2. Extract the downloaded zip into a directory of your choice.
3. Open the directory and run `DFend.exe`.

Option 2 - Git clone

1. Open an administrator command prompt and `cd` to a directory where you want to install.
2. `git clone https://github.com/Defacto2/defacto2-dosbox.git`
3. `defacto2-dosbox\dfend.exe`

#### Profiles

Most of the D-Fend profiles should be self-explanatory for anyone familiar with DOS. **Default** or **Default (max speed)** should work for most _scene_ programs. Some programs have buggy audio detection routines and with those you're best to drill down to either one of the _SoundBlaster_ or the _Gravis Ultrasound_ profiles, instead of using the _Defaults_ that have multiple soundcards.

The _debug:_ profiles are mostly to troubleshoot in case the DOS software has incompatibility issues with certain hardware. Some demos work better with _VGA_ instead of the _Default_'s _SVGA_. Others need all the audio emulation disabled to function correctly.

#### VirtualHD

The D-Fend VirtualHD (virtual `C:` drive) has some DOS tools and utilities.

Please note while D-Fend, DOSBox and the configurations are under a GPL-3.0 licence. The files within `VirtualHD` are probably not, and are proprietary unless they state otherwise.
