                          UPGRADE ENHANCEMENTS

              Version 3.6 PKware File Compression Programs



 1.  FAST !  PKARC is now up to 25% faster

             PKXARC is now up to 10% faster 

 2.  You can add 3,095 files to an archive in one sweep.

 3.  Special limited-disk-size handling to enable the update of archive
     files which are larger than 50% of your floppy disk storage area.

 4.  Added flexibility to the MOVE option by combining it with other
     update and freshen options.

 5.  A  List Files  feature has been added to further automate the
     archiving and file reconstruction process.

 6.  Your choice of having PKARC stop when it encounters a "can't find"
     file situation, or having it make a notation on the screen and then
     proceeding to the next step.

 7.  Improved network support.

 8.  The addition of the MORE command for the PKARC verbose file listing
     which provides pausing after each screen of information.  

 9.  The addition of the MORE command for PKXARC which provides pausing
     after each screen of information during the "extract file to the
     screen" process.
     
10.  New printer options for PKXARC.

11.  A new  -n  option which saves time by reconstructing only the most
     recent version of the file to be extracted when another same-named
     file already resides on your disk.

12.  Additional information about the archiving process is displayed
     which includes the version number and program.

                    Introduction to File Compression

File Compression

     The term "compression" means to reduce in size.   Computer file
     compression means that by using PKware programs, files are quickly
     reduced in size and thereby take up less storage space.  This
     process, sometimes called ARCing, creates ARCHIVE files.  

     Archive files have three distinct benefits:

         1.  They use less disk space than normal files.  Archive filing
             increases the life and storage availability of your expensive
             hard disk.

         2.  Many individual files can be stuffed into a single archive
             file.  This makes file group identification, copying, and
             transporting faster and easier.

         3.  Archived files travel faster via modem which reduces
             telecommunication transmission and reception.  Many BBS
             (computer bulletin board services) use PKware archive files
             as their standard.  This enables the BBS to store more files
             and you to have easier access to them by way of speedier
             communications.

Two Related PKware Programs - PKARC & PKXARC

     Together, PKARC and PKXARC handle all of your file compression needs.

     PKARC is the program that compresses files.  This shrinking process
     is often referred to as archiving or ARCing and it results in the
     creation of an ARCHIVE file.  Terms you will see during the compress-
     ing process are Stored, Packed, Squeezed, Crunched and Squashed. 
     PKARC also handles all ARCHIVE file maintenance including adding and
     deleting files, as well as reporting on technical information from
     within the archive.

     PKXARC (note the added X in the title) is the program that
     reconstructs or extracts archived files.  A shorthand word for this
     process is UNarcing.  In addition to UNarcing a complete archive
     file, it can selectively release individual files, and show files on
     the screen for fast viewing, or print them out on a printer.

Three Special Programs - PKSFX - PKARCJR & PKXARCJR

     There are times you must give archived files to people who do not
     have PKware programs, or who have not yet learned how to use them. 
     PKSFX creates a "self-extracting" file.  This means that the archive
     can be reconstructed WITHOUT using PKXARC.  The people who receive
     the archives you have created will be able to use them immediately.

     The JR series of PKware does everything that PKARC and PKXARC does,
     however, they were designed to work within a limited memory area. 
     This is of particular importance to programmers who use PKware within
     their own program or creations.

File Compression Terms

     FILE COMPRESSION is the process of reducing a file's size.  Sometimes
     called ARCing or compressing.

     FILE means the SINGLE name that identifies information on your floppy
     disk or hard drive.

     ARCHIVE FILE holds information that has been reduced in size for
     better storage.  Sometimes called an ARC or ARCed file.

     An ARCHIVE FILE can be made up of either one big file OR several
     files bunched together under one file name.

     A file with the extension ARC    FileName.ARC    is a SINGLE file

     FILE RECONSTRUCTION  or  FILE EXTRACTION  refers to the process of
     recreating files that have been previously compressed or ARCed. 
     People also refer to this as OPENING UP FILES or UNarcing.

             Using PKware with Hard and Floppy Disk Systems

PKware works BEST on a hard disk system.  

 1.  Even though you are making files smaller, the process used to shrink
     them can BRIEFLY DOUBLE the storage space you need.  The process
     creates a NEW archive which will be used as a REPLACEMENT for the old
     version.  Both the OLD and the NEW versions will be on your disk
     until just prior to the program's final stages.

 2.  When you UNarc (reconstruct) a file, the amount of space needed to
     hold that file can double.  A large hard disk drive normally insures
     that enough storage area is available.

Many ARCed (compressed) files are stored on floppy disks.  The limit to
floppy storage is the number of characters your floppy system will hold:

     Standard double density floppy     360K
     High density floppy                1.2 meg 
     3-1/2" floppy                      .7 or 1.4 meg 

You may have problems either ADDING files to an archive stored on a floppy
disk, or UNarcing files to a floppy disk system when the number of
characters in the archive file is more than 50% of the available storage
space of one floppy.  Consider a standard floppy disk system:

   |                  Standard Floppy Disk Drive of 360K              |
   |                                                                  |
   |  A:> BigFile.ARC  has 250,000 characters                         |
   |                                                                  |
   |           1.  In order to ADD files to BigFile.ARC, you need     |
   |               500,000 of space.  The extra space is used to      |
   |               hold a NEW updated archive created BEFORE the old  |
   |               archive is deleted.                                |
   |                                                                  |
   |           2.  The reconstructed (UNarced) BigFile might require  |
   |               400,000 of space.                                  |
   |                                                                  |
   |  B:>  ...   (The LIMIT it can expand to is 360,000 characters)   |
   |__________________________________________________________________|

There are a number of ways to avoid the limitations.  A thorough knowledge
of PKware Programs will show you how to:

     1.  Selectively RECONSTRUCTING files from an archive.  Instead of
         UNarcing everything at once, you can view file size information
         and then select SPECIFIC FILES to be reconstructed (UNarced) to a
         floppy.  (See pages 1, 14)

     2.  Create the archive file on your second disk drive so that you
         have the full 360K available to you.  (See page 7)

     3.  Use of the special  -b  command which routes the NEW file to a
         larger disk drive during the archiving process then copies it
         back to the floppy upon completion.  (See page 22)

                   General Rules and DEFAULT Settings


 1.  PKware programs MUST be located in:

     A.  The drive you are working on, OR . . .

     B.  Any directory accessible through the PATH= setting.

         C:> PATH=C:/Utils

         In this example, PKware is in the Utils Directory.  The computer
         will find and execute the program even though you are in a
         different directory or drive.  Consult your MS-DOS documentation.

     C.  Any directory through the use of PATH notation if you are using
         MS-DOS 3.0 or later.


         C:>B:PKARC  a  OldFile.ARC  *.*      PKARC is located on the
                                              B:> drive

         C:>\UTILS\PKARC  v  Stuff.ARC        PKarc is located in \UTILS
                                              as indicated in the PATH
                                              notation

 2.  All PKware program commands are typed at the prompt.


 3.  Typed information can be in CAPS, lower case, or a mixture.
       ____________________________________________________________
       |                                                          |
       | IMPORTANT:  In FUTURE versions of PKware, the commands   |
       |             must be typed in lower case.                 |
       |__________________________________________________________|


 4.  The DEFAULT is  *.*  or ALL FILES when specific files are not named.


 5.  It is NOT necessary to type the extension  .ARC  when processing an
     archive file.  This extension is used in this documentation for
     clarity.


 6.  A   HELP SCREEN  is displayed when you type the program name at the
     prompt then hit carriage return/enter.

            C:>PKARC      enter       gives you HELP
            C:>PKXARC     "            "    "    "







                                  - 5 -

 7.  The notation  *  or  *.ARC  will UNarc all archive files within a
     given area.


 8.  During the UNarcing process, the notation *.* will tell PKXARC to try
     to reconstruct ALL files whether archives or not.  This would waste
     time, but will not damage any files.


 9.  The default area for the work-in-progress archive is on the same
     drive as the original archive.  As this can cause a space shortage on
     a floppy disk, the -b option is recommended.  (See page 4 on disk
     space use, and page 22 on the -b option)


10.  The archiving function will STOP if specific, pre-specified files are
     not found.  This default can be changed in the configuration file to
     the RELAXED mode which will make a notation on the screen regarding
     file absence, then will continue processing.  (See page 20)


11.  All MS-DOS file handling procedures can be used:

               Filename.ext          Full file name designations

                  *Name.ext          Names with wild card markers 
                      *.ext         
               Filename.*
                      *.*
               File?ame.ext

             A:filename.ext          Disk drive and file name

             C:\Lotus\March\*.*      Disk drive and PATH locations

          How Each PKARC Area 2 Command Archiving Option Works 


REFER To Page 7   "Quick Start" for setup patterns
         Page 5   "General Rules and DEFAULT Settings"
         Page 8   "TABLE:  Commands used in AREA 2 of PKARC Archiving
                   Process"

SIZE         An archive can hold any number of files subject to the
FACTORS      storage size of your disk.  You NEED unused storage space at
             least equal to the size of the existing archive in order to
             complete any updating process.  (See page 4 & 22 for a
             complete description.)

                 250K Archive needs   250K for ACTUAL storage
                                      250K for the UPDATING process

             No more than 24 PATHS can be specified during a single
             session.  This includes PATHS within all List Files as well
             as on the command line.

             The actual List File (page 17) is limited to 32K.  This does
             NOT limit the size of the files it selects.

             Although a single archive can hold an UNLIMITED number of
             files, the maximum number of files for one archiving session
             is 3,977 for PKARC and 2,425 for PKARCJR.  The session can be
             repeated over and over again.

       |_______________________________________________________________|


a - Add files to an archive

        Add files to either a NEWLY CREATED or EXISTING archive file.  
        Same-name files will overwrite those already in the archive
        regardless of which has the latest date. 

        A:>PKARC  a  Arrange   Flowers.Txt  Pictures.Wks  Pots.Dbs

            Once the program is finished creating a new archive, the
            extension  .ARC  will be added to the word "Arrange" making it 
            Arrange.ARC




                                  - 9 -

u - Update existing files with most recent time & date, PLUS add new
    files to an EXISTING archive

        Although similar to the   a - Add   command, it has an update
        SAFEGUARD.  It will overwrite existing archived files ONLY if the
        selected files have the most recent time and date.  It will also
        add new files to the archive.
                         
        C:>PKARC  u  OldFile.ARC   *.Txt  Money.Wks  A:Funds.Wks         


f - Update ONLY existing files in an archive with most recent time & date

        Limited to working with files that ALREADY exist within an ar-
        chive.  It will overwrite existing archived files ONLY if the
        selected files have the most recent time and date.  It will NOT
        add new files.

        C:>PKARC  f  Picky.ARC  *.*

            PKARC will automatically select only the files listed within
            Picky.ARC from the range noted as *.*

i - Selective BACKUP feature

        Add only files to the archive that WERE NOT backed up the last
        time.  The notation "No files found" means that everything had
        been previously backed up.


m - Add files to a new OR existing archive then automatically DELETE
    the original or source file

        Similar to the  a - Add  command except that it automatically
        deletes the original files.  This is a REAL TIME SAVER, for
        example, when compressing an entire directory.  The  m  option
        stuffs all your files into a single archive, then deletes the
        surrounding files.

        The deletion is completed after the program verifies archiving
        accuracy.  If an error does occur, such as DISK FULL, the original
        files will NOT be deleted.

        C:\DBASE >PKARC  m  tiny.ARC  *.dbf

            In this example, all the database files will be archived into
            tiny.ARC and then will be erased from the /DBASE directory.

mu - Combination of  m & u  features  

        Does everything the  u  command does plus automatically deletes
        the source files involved in the transaction.





                                 - 10 -

mf - Combination of  m & f  features

        Does everything the  f  command does plus automatically deletes
        the source files involved in the transaction.


x - Label (describe) the actual ARChive file - you will be prompted for
                                               a description

        Will prompt you to create a 32 character description of an archive
        file.  

            1.  Describe new archive
            2.  Describe existing archive
            3.  Change the description on an existing archive

        The  x  can be used alone on an EXISTING archive file or in
        COMBINATION with any of the 5 add/update commands as well as with
        the "c - label individual files".  See chart on page 8 for
        patterns.


c - Label (describe) individual files WITHIN an archive - you will be
                                                          prompted for 
                                                          a description

        Will prompt you to create a 32 character description of a file
        found within an archive file.  

            1.  Describe all newly added files
            2.  Describe all existing files
            3.  Change the description on all existing files
            4.  Select SPECIFIC existing files for description

        The  c  can be used alone on an EXISTING archive file, or
        COMBINATION with any of the 5 add/update commands as well as
        with the "x - label archive file".
        

g - Create a password protected ARCHIVE file or protect INDIVIDUAL
    files within an archive file

    SEE   "Password Protection Procedures"  page 18.
        

d - Delete individual or a range of files from WITHIN an ARCHIVE

        Will delete a single or multiple files within an archive using
        any of the MS-DOS file handling descriptions.  You will see the
        name of the file on the screen as it is being deleted.

        C:>PKARC  d  OldFile.ARC   Garbage.Txt  Useless.Dbf

            In this sample, Garbage.Txt and Useless.Dbf were deleted
            from the numerous files found on OldFile.ARC

|      An ARCHIVE file is one which holds a lot of information in       |
|      a greatly reduced space.  Use the PKXARC program to UNarc,       |
|      or reconstruct an archive file.                                  |

DEFAULTS     See page 14  "Complete File RECONSTRUCTION or EXTRACTION
             Command Structure Including Optional Areas"

             See page 5  "General Rules & DEFAULT Settings"


SIZE         Files can be extracted up to the available storage on your
FACTORS      disk.

             Only 240 files can be specified from a List File (page 17)
             within one sweep.


OPTIONAL COMMANDS:

-r   =   Files will be extracted without prompting and WILL AUTOMATICALLY
         OVERWRITE any other same-named files found in that area on the
         disk.  It will turn off the "overwrite" default.  


-n   =   Files will be extracted with an OVERWRITING SAFEGUARD.  It will
         NOT allow an older version of a file in an archive to overwrite a
         newer version on disk as defined by the time and date created.  

-c   =   Extracts files to the screen only.  The files flow non-stop.


-cm  =   Same as  -c  and adds the command MORE.  Information will flow on
         to the screen and will STOP when the display area is filled.  You
         will be prompted to request MORE information.
     
                Spacebar      - gives you next screen full
                Enter         - plays out line-by-line
                ESC           - will abort this file and jump to display
                                the NEXT file in sequence
               Ctrl + C  or   - Quit (abort) the process
               Ctrl + Break


-t   =   Displays whether an archive is good or has been corrupted. 

                                 - 15 -

-v   =   Lists (prints out on the screen) the contents of an archive from
         within the PKXARC program.  See PKARC Chart on page 8, and
         indepth explanation on page 12 for a MORE COMPLETE content and
         information listing.


-vv  =   Displays the ARCHIVE PROGRAM AND VERSION that created the archive
         file. 


-g   =   Extract password protected archive.  CARE must be taken to insure
         proper retrieval of your files.

         SEE   "Password Protection Procedures" page 18 for instructions.


-p   =   Extracts files and sends them to the printer for printing.  It
         will NOT change the printer device mode from prior setting and
         WILL default to whatever was used last (see  -pa  and  -pb ). 


-pa  =   Same as  -p  but specifically sets printer device to the ASCII
         mode.  This is commonly used to print text.  It will form feed
         after each file.


-pb  =   Same as  -p  but specifically sets printer device to BINARY mode. 
         This corresponds to the COPY command commonly used to send fonts
         or graphics to a laser printer.  It will NOT form feed after each
         file.

                    Creating a Pre-Selected File List


Create List Files to record file selections you use frequently.

With PKARC:  Can be used with any commands except the View Technical and
             File Information commands. See Command Structure Chart page
             8, Col 7 & 8   PATH directions can be used inside the list.

With PKXARC: Can be used with ANY default or optional command.  No PATH
             location can be used inside the list.

How to Use the List:

     The List File is preceded by the @ symbol.  If the List File is
     not in the directory, the @ symbol is put BEFORE the PATH 
     designation.

     The List File can be mixed with other selections.

            C:>PKXARC  -r  NewFile.ARC   @Group

                           Password Protection


Password Protection keeps your files LOCKED.  It is important that you
follow EXACT procedures to insure that you can retrieve your files when
you want them.  

PKARC and PKXARC contain NO record of your password.  The protection is
provided through a mathematical matching process contained in the CRC
check. 

WARNING:  Without the correct password, you file is garbled and CANNOT be
retrieved.

Refer to Command Reference Table for PKARC, page 8 for further
information.

                        LAN - Local Area Network

PKXARC automatically opens all archives with SHARE "deny write access"
under DOS 3.0 or above, so that files can be read concurrently by other
tasks.   PKARC uses a UNIQUE filename for all temporary files created. 
This allows PKARC to be run by concurrent programs or on a network drive
without any file contention or conflict.

PKARC 3.6 can be forced to use fixed names for temporary files under DOS
3.0 and above by adding the line  TEMPNAMES=FIXED  to the configuration
file.  Care should be taken when using this option to make sure that
either the current directory or the directory pointed to by the PKARCTMP
environment variable (see below) is on a local drive, to prevent any file
contention when PKARC is run concurrently on multiple networked machines.


            PKARC Archiving Configuration File Considerations


The config file MUST be set as an environmental string.  Two settings can
reside in the PKARC.CFG file which are:

         ARCCOPY=C:\        Discussion on page 22

         FILECHECK=NORMAL    |__ choose either   
                  =RELAXED   |

         The default is "normal" which means that the program STOPS if it
         does not find a specified file.  The "relaxed" mode will simply
         make a notation on the screen that a file is NOT FOUND and will
         continue the process of archiving.  (See pages 6 and 9)

Two ENVIRONMENTAL VARIABLES can also be set.  This will speed up the time
it takes to execute the program.

     C:>SET  PKARC.CFG=C:\UTILS      --->  In this case, PKARC.CFG is
                                           located in \UTILS directory.
                                           Use the location of your
                                           choice.

     C:>SET  PKARCTMP=D:             --->  This speeds up the program     
                      |                    operation DEFAULT by directing
                      |                    the mechanics of PKARC to a
                      RAM disk.            RAM disk.
                      Drive Notation 
                      your choice.         NOTE:  This has NOTHING to do
                                           with the creation of the "new"
                                           archive file during the add or
                                           upgrade process.

   Use of PKware in Batch File and Other Programs Where RAM is Limited 


The amount of RAM memory needed is as follows:

     PKARC   -   125K                  PKARCJR   -  90K
     PKXARC  -    92K                  PKXARCJR  -  68K
     PKSFX   -    71K

Number of files that can be handled during ONE sweep:

     PKARC  3,977 files in archive    PKARCJR  2,425 files in archive

There is NO limit to the amount of files an archive can hold outside of
available disk space.

The JR series of PKware does everything that the standard series does
except that it requires less memory, executes somewhat slower, and holds
1,552 fewer files in a single archive.  The JR series is excellent to use
in a smaller computer, environments using programs similar to DesqView,
Double DOS, Software Carousal, or linked with other programs developed in
dBase, Clipper, FoxBase, C, etc.
 
You can test if PKXARC experienced an error by using the DOS error level
variable.  PKXARC returns zero error level if no errors have occurred.  If
an error has occurred, PKXARC will display the following error codes:

     Abort Exit Codes
         2 - out of memory
         3 - no archives found to extract
         4 - can't open archive file
         5 - read error on archive
         6 - internal table overflow
         7 - disk full

     Non-Abort (warning) Exit Codes
         1 - bad CRC, file is not an archive, unknown compression method,
             can't create a file, squeeze table is invalid or no files
             found to extract.

You can test if PKARC has aborted with an error using the DOS error level
variable.  PKARC returns a non-zero error level if an error occurred, and
a zero error level for normal termination.


                      Use of a RAM Disk with PKARC

PKARC swaps information on and off disk memory as it runs.  This process
is NOT the same as the physical creation of the NEW archive.  The default
drive for this program activity is the drive from which the program was
executed.  You can speed up performance as well as gain disk space by
telling PKARC which drive and/or subdirectory to use through a DOS
environmental strings.  (See page 20)  All routing can be directed to your
RAM Disk.

          C:>PKARCTMP=D:   --->  where "D:" stands for the RAM disk

                       Limited Disk Storage Space
                    Creating or Adding to an Archive

PKARC creates a NEW pre-archive file every time you add information to an
existing one.  When the updating is completed, the old archive is
automatically deleted and the pre-archive file is substituted.  

Available disk storage space must be at minimum EQUAL TO or bigger than
the old archive.  If this is not available, the program will stop.

Space is not a problem on a hard disk.  It does pose restrictions on a
floppy disk.

You can route the creation of the pre-archive to another disk drive
through the combination of three activities:

     1.  The  -b  command option
     2.  The creation of a PKARC.CFG config file which routes temporary
         files.
     3.  The setting of a MS-DOS environmental string.

The routing will cause more time to be used during the pre-archive
process, however, you can use it to successfully avoid floppy disk
limitations.

                         How An ARCHIVE is Made
                                                                          
      PKARC creates a temporary archive file that has an extension        
      of .$$$  such as in  OldFile.$$$  during the archiving              
      process.  OldFile.$$$ is the upgraded version of OldFile.ARC        
                                                                          
      When all of your files have been successfully ARCed, the            
      old archive is deleted and the file with the extension .$$$         
      is simply renamed with a new extension .ARC                         
                                                                          
      It is FASTER to rename the temporary archive file than to           
      copy it from one disk drive to another.  The FASTEST way to         
      create your archive files is to do so from your largest disk 
      drive.  The -b option is used only when your space is limited.

      Compatibility of PKware with Other File Compression Programs

PKware is upwardly compatible with all its own upgrades as well as with
most other file compression programs.  You can UNarc almost all of the
archive files that have been created.

There may be times when you need to CREATE an archive that is compatible
to one which can be read by SEA's ARChiving program.  This means you will
use LESS features to maintain compatibility.

         C:>PKARC  otc   a   OldFile.ARC   *.*  
                   ___
                    |
                    |
                    This option, which IMMEDIATELY follows the program
                    name, will create an archive file that is compatible
                    with SEA's ARC.


                           Archive Time & Date

By default, whenever an archive is created or updated, PKARC will set the
date of the archive file to the LAST TIME it was manipulated.  It is
possible to change the default so that the archive file date will be that
of the LATEST FILE WITHIN the archive.

The string  ARCHTIME=LATEST  in the PKARC.CFG file will direct the program
to set the archive file date to match the date of the latest file within
the archive.

The option  -ot  can be used IN PLACE OF the configuration file:

            C:>PKARC  -ot  a  OldFile.ARC

If you do have the alternative dating procedure set up in your configura-
tion file, you can OVERRIDE it with the  -nt  option:

            C:>PKARC  -nt  a  BigFile.ARC


                           Disabling Squashing

PKARC employs a compression technique known as Squashing.  Most archive
programs can extract squashed files.  Older archive programs, or archive
programs for some computers, may not support this method.  Squashing can
be disabled in PKARC by placing  SQUASH=DISABLE  in the PKARC.CFG file.

If you have placed the  SQUASH=DISABLE  string in your configuration file,
you can disable it using the  -oc  option:

            C:>PKARC  -oc  a  MoreFile.ARC

You can also invoke the  -nt  option to OVERRIDE any directions in the
configuration file so that Squashing is used.

           C:>PKARC  -nt  a  Ordinary.ARC

                  PKARC - File Compression / Archiving


Insufficient memory

     There is not enough free RAM memory to run PKARC.  Try using PKARCJR
     which uses less RAM memory.

Insufficient memory for List Files

     There is not enough free RAM memory to run PKARC.  The physical "File
     List" file exceeds the RAM memory of your computer.  Break the large
     "File List" into several small "File Lists."

No archive specified
     
     The name of the archive file  (a file with an ARC extension) was not
     keyed correctly OR not keyed in at all.

No files specified for deletion

     SPECIFIC names must be given for file deletion.  

Can't find the "file/s specified"

     The specified file or files can not be found and archiving will not
     proceed.  The program will be aborted.

     NOTE:  If you choose the RELAXED method in your PKware config file,
     you will get the same warning, however, the program will CONTINUE. 
     (See page 20)

No file(s) found

     No files were found to add or update to the archive.

Can't create file "specified"

     The specified file can not be created.
     1.  The output directory has been incorrectly keyed
     2.  The output directory does not exist
     3.  The directory is full
     4.  The number of FILES specified in your computer's Config.Sys is
         too small.  The minimum should be  FILES=12.

Too many files

     The standard archive can store 3,977 files at a time.  PKARCJR can
     store 2,425.

Too many paths

     A limit of 24 different drive and/or PATH specifiers can be used at a
     time.

                 PKARC - File Compression / Archiving

                        Error Messages, continued


"Specified archive file" - Error in Archive 

     1.  Although a file with the extension ARC is on the disk, it is not
         a true archive.

     2.  The name of the archive was mis-keyed

     3.  The archive was damaged or corrupted

Can't open "specified archive file"

     1.  The File Command Options (page 8) work only on an existing
         archive.

     2.  The archive name may be misspelled.
     
Disk full

     The disk you are working on is full.  You will be told specific
     information about which disk area is full: 

                    Drive   Path   File Location

"Specified archive file" is read-only!

     The displayed archive file is a read-only or system file.  No
     modification (add, update, delete, etc.) is possible.

Can't open config file:  PKARC.CFG

     The environment string PKARC.CFG= is incorrect, or a file error
     occurred while opening the configuration file.


Insufficient disk space for updated archive -- "specified archive file"

     Only happens when the -b option is used during addition or upgrading
     of files.  Although your file might have been successfully compiled
     on a large disk drive, there may not be enough space on the small
     drive to hold the increased size of the archive.

Warning!  File "selected" already exists!  overwrite (y/n)?

     A file to be extracted from the archive already exists on disk.
         Answer   Y    "selected file"  will overwrite what is on disk
                  N     "        "      will NOT overwrite what is on disk

     Use of the  -r  option will avoid this warning.


Unknown packing method for:  "selected file"

     The file is compressed or encoded in an unknown way.  The archive is
     either CORRUPT or requires a LATER VERSION of PKXARC for proper
     extraction.


Warning!  File "selected" fails CRC check

     The file is probably corrupt.  The Cyclic Redundancy Check
     calculation did not match the stored value.


"Selected archive file" - error in archive 

     The file selected is either not an archive or is corrupt.


Can't find "selected archive file"

     The selected archive file cannot be found.  This could be caused by a
     typing error or the actual absence of a file.


No files found

     The select file/s within an archive do not exist or have been
     miskeyed.


Can't create:  "selected file"

     The output DIRECTORY is either INVALID or FULL.  Check your directory
     name and/or whether or not it has been created. 


File has invalid decode tree

     The file is corrupt.
