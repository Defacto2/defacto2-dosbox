Features of PKARC FAST! Archive Create/Update Utility,
	    PKXARC FAST! Archive Extract Utility and
	    PKSFX FAST! Self-Extract Utility:

  o PKARC can compress your files to increase disk storage capacity
    and reduce modem transmission time.  PKARC can typically compress
    files better than any other comparible archive utility.

  o PKARC can place many files into one archive file, reducing the
    number of files needed to be stored on diskettes or a hard disk.
    The files within each archive can be listed in alphabetical
    order, and the exact number of files in each archive displayed.
    Each archive and each file within an archive can be given a
    comment up to 32 characters in length, allowing for easy
    self-documenting archives.  Using PKFIND, all archive files on a
    diskette or hard disk can be easily searched for specific files.

  o PKARC employs several differnt state-of-the-art data compression
    algorithms, and uses the most optimal method for each file.  The
    result of the compression is an average savings in disk space of
    40-60%, with spreadsheet and database files oftentimes compressing to
    1/10th of their original size or less.  In addition to doubling disk
    storage capacity, this can reduce modem transmission time in half!

  o PKARC and PKXARC have full archive maintenance functions and 
    advanced features, such as file encryption, configuartion 
    options, and multitasking & network support.  Data intregity
    is ensured by a 16 bit CRC.

  o PKSFX converts an archive file into an executable file that
    automatically extracts and decompresses your files when run,
    creating convenient self-extracting archives.

  o PKARC, PKXARC, and PKSFX are written in C, with highly optimized
    assembly language routines, making them the FASTEST archive programs
    available anywhere.

  o PKARC, PKXARC, and PKSFX will run on any MS-DOS computer using MS-DOS
    version 2.0 or above, and require only 90K of free memory to run.

  o PKARC, PKXARC, and PKSFX are not copy protected.


Features of PKFIND:
        
  o PKFIND File Finder Plus works like some other "whereis" type 
    programs, except with an important Plus.  The Plus is that PKFIND 
    will not only search all the directories on your diskette or hard 
    disk like other "whereis" programs, but PKFIND will search 
    through archive files too.  Once PKFIND finds the desired file, 
    PKFIND can automatically change to the subdirectory where the 
    file was found!  PKFIND will allow you to find any file, archived 
    or not, simply and easily.
        
  o PKFIND will run on any MS-DOS machine running MS-DOS version 2.0
    or above, and requires only 32K of free memory to run.
            
  o PKFIND is not copy protected.
