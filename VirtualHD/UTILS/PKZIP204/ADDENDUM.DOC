    ADDENDUM to PKZIP 2 Manual
    --------------------------

    This file contains the most up-to-date information and additions and
    changes to the PKZIP version 2 manual.


      AUTHENTICITY VERIFICATION FEATURE
      ---------------------------------

	The Authenticity Verification information you receive from PKWARE
	will include two AV Serial Numbers and one checksum.  The Serial
	Numbers include BOTH letters and numbers.  ALL LETTERS in the
	Serial Numbers are LOWER CASE.

	After both Serial Numbers are entered using the PUTAV.EXE, the
	program will return a checksum value.  This checksum must match
	the one provided by PKWARE.  If the checksums do not match, then
	the installation was not performed correctly and PUTAV.EXE should
	be run again to ensure that the Serial Numbers and Name were
	entered correctly.

	If you run PUTAV.EXE and you encounter the error, "ERROR IN
	PKZIP.EXE", verify that you are running PUTAV on the registered
	version of PKZIP.EXE.
	
      
      AVEXTRA.TXT
      -----------

	With the PKZIP 2 Authenticity Verification feature, additional
	text can be displayed on subsequent lines following the
	verification message.  An ASCII text file named AVEXTRA.TXT is
	created containing the additional text you want displayed.  When
	the AVEXTRA.TXT file is in the current directory when you use the
	"PKZIP -!" option, PKZIP will add this text to the .ZIP file and
	PKUNZIP will display it after the normal Authenticity
	Verification message.  The Authenticity Verification feature is
	available only to registered users of PKZIP.


      SELF-EXTRACTING FILES ACROSS MULTIPLE DISKETTES
      -----------------------------------------------

	PKZIP 2 has the ability to compress a large .ZIP file across
	multiple diskettes.

	Self-extracting files CAN NOT span multiple disks.  This would
	make the PKSFX code extremely large.

	A simple batch file can be created that would uncompress across
	multiple diskettes.  All that would be required is to have the
	batch file follow this procedure:


	1.  Create a batch file called install.bat
	2.  Edit install.bat and in that file have the following line:

		  pkunzip -d a:program c:\test

	This batch file would create the directory C:\TEST on your
	computer and then unzip the file called PROGRAM.ZIP into the c:\test
	directory.  PKUNZIP will prompt the user to enter the diskettes
	in the extraction order.


      PKCFG.EXE
      ---------

      * PKCFG is only included in the registered version of PKZIP.

	PKZIP can have many of its features configured with a
	configuration file called PKZIP.CFG.  This configuration file can
	be located in either your current directory, a directory
	specified with the environment variable PKZIP.CFG, or in the
	directory that PKZIP.EXE is located.  PKZIP will search for the
	configuration in each location in the order listed above.  This
	means that you may have a default configuration file that is
	easily overridden by using a configuration file in either of the
	first two locations.  Any option that is set in the configuration
	file may be overridden from the command line.  The configuration
	file may be created manually with a text editor.

	The PKCFG program will look for an existing configuration file in
	the same locations and order that PKZIP would look.  If the PKCFG
	program finds an existing configuration file it will load it.
	The existing configuration values will be shown in the place of
	the defaults.  A list of options will be displayed on the screen,
	and a highlighted cursor indicates the option that you can
	modify.


      PK SAFE ANSI
      -----------

	Another program included with registration of PKZIP 2 is called
	PKSFANSI.COM.  PKSFANSI is a terminate and stay resident program
	that disables ANSI keyboard key Reassignments, thereby preventing
	ANSI "bombs" embedded in any text file (such as README files) or
	output by any program.  Normally, ANSI sequences that redefine
	the keyboard could be hidden inside ANY text file or program, and
	could be executed completely unnoticed until it is too late.
	PKSFANSI intercepts calls to the ANSI.SYS or other ANSI device
	drivers, and filters out any keyboard reassignments, while
	allowing other ANSI sequences through unaltered.  If a keyboard
	reassignment is attempted, PKSFANSI will intercept the sequence
	and discard it.  PKSFANSI will also BEEP to alert you that a
	reassignment was attempted.


	PKSFANSI requires less than 1K bytes resident RAM, and should
	work with any ANSI driver, such as the standard ANSI.SYS driver,
	NANSI, ZANSI, DVANSI, etc.  Note that if you use a memory
	resident ANSI driver, such as the DESQview DVANSI.COM driver,
	PKSFANSI should be loaded after the ANSI driver is loaded.


      Using PKZIP and DPMI
      --------------------

	If you experience difficulties when using PKZIP in a DOS window
	under Windows, use the -) option to disable DPMI support.  If
	this eliminates the problem, you may default this option for
	PKZIP by using the configuration file (see manual for details).
	With PKUNZIP, this option may be set as an environment variable
	(see below for details).


      PKUNZIP as an Environment Variable
      ----------------------------------

	PKUNZIP includes the ability to use an environment variable as a
	continuation of the command line.  An option, or number of
	options may be specified by an environment variable.  PKUNZIP
	will treat the variables as if they were passed on the command
	line.

		 example: set PKUNZIP=-)

	  This example would disable DPMI usage.

	Note that since the PKUNZIP environment variable is a
	continuation of the command line; it will supersede any
	preceding option on the command line.


      Minimum DOS Requirements for SPANNING & FORMATTING
      --------------------------------------------------

	For PKZIP 2 to span multiple disks with a .ZIP file, DOS 3.0 or
	greater is required.

	To be able to format diskettes on-the-fly, DOS 3.2 or greater is
	required.


      PKUNZJR.COM & PKSFX Junior
      --------------------------

	When using PKUNZJR or PKSFX Junior, remember to end you output
	path with a : or a \.  Because the PKUNZJR and PKSFX Junior were
	designed to be as small as possible, please note that they
	perform minimal error checking.


      PKZIP BACKUP GUIDE
      ------------------

	PKZIP can now create .ZIP files that exceed the size of a floppy
	disk.  You can use PKZIP to backup your entire hard disk and
	unlike most backup programs, PKZIP can use disks formatted by
	DOS, or it can format the disk for you.  PKZIP can optionally
	erase all files on the destination disk(s), or leave those files
	intact.  PKZIP can optionally quick format the destination
	disk(s), or do a normal (unconditional) format.  A quick format
	erases the information on the disk without formatting each
	track, greatly reducing the time required to format a disk.

	Option    Description
	--------------------------------------------------------------------
	  -&      Span disks if necessary.

	You must specify this option if you wish to create a .ZIP file
	on multiple disks.  If this option is not specified and you
	exceed the capacity of a floppy disk, a DISK FULL error message
	will result.

	  -&f     Format the destination disk.

	PKZIP will format the destination disk(s) if you specify this
	option.  If the disk has been formatted previously, a quick
	format will be performed, otherwise a full format will be
	performed.

	  -&fl    The destination disk is to be formatted to low density.

	If you plan to use low density disks in a high density disk
	drive, this option is required.  For example, if you have a 1.44
	meg floppy disk drive, and plan to zip to 720K disks and your
	disks are not formatted, you must specify this option.  If your
	disk drive is a 360K or 720K drive, this option is not required.
	If any information was previously contained on the disk, it will
	be erased.


	  -&u     Unconditionally (always) format the disk.

	Always format the disk before being used.  A full format will be
	used, a quick format will never be performed.  If any information
	was previously contained on the disk, it will be erased.

	  -&ul    Unconditionally (always) format a low density disk in a
		  high density disk drive.

	Always format the disk before being used.  A full format will be
	used, a quick format will never be performed. If any information
	was previously contained on the disk, it will be erased.

	  -&w     Wipe the disk.  (Erase all files and subdirectories)

	This is similar to -&f, except the files are deleted, rather than
	formatting the disk.  This is for usage with non floppy removable
	devices, such as Bernoulli boxes.

	  -&s[d:] Include subdirectories in zipping process (similar to
		  -rp \*.*).

	This option tells PKZIP that you wish to backup the entire disk
	drive.  The current disk drive will be used if no disk drive is
	specifed.  You do not need to specify the -rp option (recurse and
	store pathnames).  If you also specify files on another disk
	drive, these files will be compressed, as well as all files on the
	default drive.  (Please see following examples.)

	All options are case insensitive, but this may change in future
	versions.  We suggest you USE LOWER CASE LETTERS FOR FUTURE
	COMPATIBILITY.  The -&l option must be specified with -&u or -&f.

	* Note:   If you create a .ZIP file with the same name as exists
	  on a disk set, you do not need to use the WIPE or FORMAT
	  options.  PKZIP will create a new .ZIP file with the same name;
	  this method is faster.

	* Note:   All the PKZIP Configuration File options can be
	  overridden on the command line by specifying the option and a
	  '-'.  For example, -&f- will override "BACKUP=FORMAT" in the
	  Configuration File and turn off formatting.


	Examples
	--------

	Command Line              Description
	-----------------------------------------------------------------
	pkzip a:zipfile -&        Zip the current directory to drive A:, and
				  span disks if necessary.  The files
				  currently on drive A: will not be affected.

	C:\>pkzip a:zipfile -&s   Zip all files on drive C: to the A: drive.

	C:\>pkzip b:zipfile -&s d:\sd\*.*  Zip all files on drive C:
					   (the current drive), and all files
					   in the D:\SD directory to the B:
					   drive.

	C:\>pkzip a:zipfile -&s d:\*.BAT   Zip all the files on drive C: and
					   all .BAT files on drive D: to the
					   A: drive.

	pkzip a:zipfile -&f -rp            Zip the current directory and its
					   subdirectories to drive A:, and
					   format each disk.  A quick format
					   will be performed if possible,
					   which is much faster than a
					   unconditional format.

	pkzip a:zipfile -&u -rp            Same as above, except the disk
					   will be unconditionally formatted.

	pkzip a:zipfile -&fl               Zip the current directory to drive
					   A:, and format each disk to low
					   density.  This option only applies
					   to users using a 360K floppy disk
					   in a 1.2 meg drive, or users using
					   a 720K floppy disk in a 1.44 meg
					   drive.  A quick format will be
					   performed if possible, which is
					   much faster than a unconditional
					   format.

	pkzip a:zipfile -&ul               Same as above, except the disk
					   will be unconditionally formatted
					   (do not quick format).

	pkzip a:zipfile -&w -rp            Zip the current directory and its
					   subdirectories to drive A:, and
					   wipe each disk.  All files and
					   subdirectories will be erased from
					   the A: drive.  The disk will not
					   be formatted or quick formatted.


	pkzip a:zipfile -&fs               Zip the current disk drive
					   (including subdirectories) to drive
					   A:, and format each disk.  If the
					   destination disk has previously
					   been formatted, a quick format will
					   be performed.  Otherwise, an
					   unconditional format will be
					   performed.


      New Options For the PKZIP.CFG Configuration File
      ------------------------------------------------
	The keyword BACKUP=  can be followed by the following keywords:

	  SPAN            The -& option is enabled.  If this keyword is not
			  specified, the following options will only be
			  enabled when -& is specified on the command line.
			  Same as -&.

	  UNCONDITIONAL   Format the disk unconditionally.  Same as -&u.

	  LOW             Using low density disks.  Same as -&l

	  FORMAT          Format the disks.  Same as -&f.

	  WIPE            Wipe the disks.  Same as -&w.

	  FULL            Do a full backup.  Same as -&s.

	Examples                             Same as
	--------------------------------------------------------
	  BACKUP=SPAN FORMAT                   -&f
	  BACKUP=SPAN FORMAT UNCONDITIONAL     -&u
	  BACKUP=LOW SPAN                      -&l
	  BACKUP=FORMAT WIPE         Illegal -- WIPE and FORMAT are exclusive.
	  BACKUP=FULL                          -&s
	  BACKUP=FULL  WIPE                    -&sw
