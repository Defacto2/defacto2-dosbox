 
                          Arc2Zip Version 1.00 Beta
 
 
   This small utility has been developed to provide an easy means to convert
any and all existing ".ARC" files to the ".ZIP" format. It will convert files
in the current directory only. You should use the "-d" option to remove the old
".ARC" files after the conversion. You can also choose the type of compression,
as well as which Archiver program to use to un-pack existing files.
 
   The author of this package is NOT affiliated with any particular company, &
has written the program ONLY to perform the conversion on his board. It was so
useful that he decided to make it available to all sysops.
 
 
Syntax is:  Arc2Zip [-Arguments]
 
Options are:
 
   -m  -> create "CONVERT.TMP" directory if necessary
   -c  -> CONVERT .Arc files to .Zip files
   -a  -> Use Pkxarc commands to unarc
   -p  -> use PkUnPak commands to unarc [default]
   -d  -> Delete OLD .Arc file when converted
   -q  -> QUIET mode (limited output)
   -1  -> Compression type 1 [Fastest]
   -2  -> Compression type 2 [default]
   -3  -> Compression type 3
   -4  -> Compression type 4 [Slowest - but smallest!]

The "DEVELOPMENT VERSION" of PKZIP/UNZIP is in no way a final
product! Many features are not implemented. We strongly suggest 
registration of the program in order to take advantage of its
extensive offerings on OFFICIAL release.

Please look for more developments from both sources as well as others.
GO FOR IT! The SWITCH IS ON (as they say).

******* NOTE !! **********>   This is a BETA version!

If any changes are made from the BETA releae to the official release,
an new version of ARC2ZIP will appear, and it may NOT be version 3.
This is a ploy to thwart those who would destroy the original program.

The next version will be clearly labeled, and placed at all proper 
and trusted distribution points.
