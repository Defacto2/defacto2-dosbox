    Welcome to the Software Development Kit and Beta software release for 
PKZIP and PKUNZIP data compression software.  If you wish to report any 
bugs in the software, please use the enclosed form in the file BUGREP.DOC.
The estimated release date for this software is January 31, 1989, so please
return any bug reports before that date if possible.

    The file README.1ST contains a complete description of all the files 
included in the development kit.

    This is NOT information on: 1) Full-screen, menu-driven versions
of the software or 2) Libraries of compression routines for incorporation
into other applications.  These things are under development and you will 
be notified as information becomes available.


    I would like to expressly thank David Schwaderer who has generously 
contributed his expertise in CRC calculations to the software.  I would 
also like to thank Graeme McRae who's principles for repeated string 
elimination, as used in his SCRNCH (tm) program, were licensed and
incorporated into the software and Bill Tullis, who coined the name "ZIP".

    In addition, I would like to thank all those (too numerous to mention)
that have supported PKWARE in the past through letters, messages, and 
registrations, and will embrace this new, next-generation in compression 
technology.
