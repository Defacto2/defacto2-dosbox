OverView
--------

The .ZIP file format was designed for high reliability, using 4-byte
signatures for all file headers, and redundant distributed & centralized
directory structures.

PKZIPFIX is a simple utility that takes advantage of the extra
reliability of the .ZIP file format to reconstruct truncated or
damaged .ZIP files.

PKZIPFIX however can not create good data out of bad data!  If a
portion of a .ZIP file has been corrupted, PKZIPFIX will allow
recovery of the unaffected files.  Depending on how badly damaged
the .ZIP file is however, one or more files may still extract with
errors.



Usage
-----

PKZIPFIX should be used when PKZIP or PKUNZIP inidcate that a .ZIP
file is in error, or a .ZIP file has become damaged.  PKZIPFIX can
also be used to extract the .ZIP file portion from a PKSFX (R) self-
extracting file.



PKZIPFIX Syntax
---------------

PKZIPFIX  ZipFile

Where ZipFile is the name of the file to be recovered.  An extension
of .ZIP will be used by default.  PKZIPFIX will attempt to recover
ZipFile and will create a file called PKFIXED.ZIP which contains the
reconstructed .ZIP file.

The file PKFIXED.ZIP can then be extracted or listed with PKUNZIP.
It is strongly recommended that you then use PKZIP to create a new
.ZIP file from the files that are extracted from PKFIXED.ZIP.
