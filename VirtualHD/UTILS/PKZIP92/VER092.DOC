Version 0.92 is a minor bug fix release for the version 0.90
software.  Registered users who received version 0.90 of the
software will be sent version 1.0 of PKZIP/PKUNZIP with manuals
for the software when available.  Version 1.0 of PKZIP/PKUNZIP
will support several new features, such as a configuration file
for PKZIP to default most of the the command line parameters,
including the compression options.


The following bugs have been fixed in version 0.92
--------------------------------------------------

The "-o" option for PKZIP version 0.90 did not work correctly
when creating a ZIP file for the first time.  This has been
corrected.

PKZIP version 0.90 could act erratically in very marginal memory
situations, this has been fixed.

If a ZIP filename longer than 8 characters was specified to PKZIP,
PKZIP could include the ZIP file itself within the new ZIP file
it was creating.  This has been corrected.

PKUNZIP version 0.90 had a rare bug that could cause Shrunk files
to extract incorrectly.  This has been fixed.

If a ZIP file was created on a network that uses undefined DOS
directory attributes, PKUNZIP version 0.90 would be unable to
extract these files in a non-networked environment.  PKUNZIP
version 0.92 now ignores any non-defined DOS attribute bits.

When using PKUNZIP version 0.90 on multiple wildcarded ZIP files,
PKUNZIP would abort if it encountered an error in a ZIP file, and
would not process the remaining ZIP files.  PKUNZIP version 0.92
will print a warning message for each bad ZIP file encountered, and
will then process the remaining ZIP files.

PKUNZIP version 0.90 did not issue a message when no files were
extracted from the specified ZIP file(s).  PKUNZIP version 0.92
now prints a message and exits with an errorlevel of 11 in this
situation.

ZIP2EXE version 0.90 could hang in situations where PKSFX.PRG was
not in the current directory or PATH.  This has been corrected.


The following new features have been added to the version 0.92
software:
---------

PKZIP now features a "-exN" option to automatically choose the
best compression method for each file.  This option will cause
PKZIP to use level N Reducing ("-ebN") for binary files.  For ASCII
files, PKZIP will try both Shrinking and level N Reducing ("-eaN")
and will use the method that compresses the best.  If the N
parameter is not specified, level 4 will be used.  (i.e. "-ex" is
equivalent to "-ex4").  For best performance with this option, it is
recommended that the PKTMP environment variable be used to point to
a RAMdisk that PKZIP can use for temporary files.


PKZipFix is now included with the software.  PKZipFix takes
advantage of the extra reliability designed into the ZIP file
format, such as 4-byte file header signatures and dual directory
structures, to recover good files from damaged or truncated ZIP
files.
